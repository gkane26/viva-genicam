# viva-genicam

High-level GenICam facade: camera discovery, feature control, image streaming, events, and action commands.

This is the main entry point for the [viva-genicam](https://github.com/VitalyVorobyev/viva-genicam) workspace. It re-exports the lower-level crates and provides convenience wrappers so you can get started with a single dependency.

## Project status — pre-1.0, and working

Users have connected, controlled and streamed from real GigE Vision cameras
with this crate — FLIR, Hikrobot and JAI models, across Linux, Windows and
macOS. The protocols are implemented against the EMVA specifications and
covered by ~370 automated tests, in-process fake cameras, and a corpus of 35
real vendor GenApi XML descriptions.

Two honest caveats, neither of which should stop you trying it:

- **The API changes between releases.** It is pre-1.0 and it moves.
- **There is no camera in CI.** The maintainer owns no hardware, so every
  hardware confirmation this project has came from a user with a device. Fake
  cameras only reproduce the behaviour we already thought of, and every
  camera-specific bug found so far was found by someone running it on a real
  device.

That second point is why a camera nobody has tried yet may still hit something.
Cameras deviate from the standard and contradict their own documentation;
working with the hardware that exists is the goal, not a compromise. **If your
camera does not work, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/VitalyVorobyev/viva-genicam/issues/new/choose)**
— and attach the camera's GenApi XML if you can, since that becomes a permanent
regression fixture for your model. That loop is how this crate has improved,
and it has worked every time it has been used.

Current gaps are tracked in
[docs/backlog.md](https://github.com/VitalyVorobyev/viva-genicam/blob/main/docs/backlog.md).

## Features

- **Discovery** -- find GigE Vision cameras on any network interface
- **Connect & control** -- `connect_gige()` one-liner for camera connection with automatic XML fetch
- **Feature access** -- typed get/set for Integer, Float, Enum, Boolean, Command, String features
- **Streaming** -- `FrameStream` async iterator with reassembly and backpressure (packet resend is implemented at the protocol layer but not yet wired into the receive path)
- **Events & actions** -- subscribe to camera events; trigger synchronized acquisition
- **Chunks & timestamps** -- parse chunk data; map device timestamps to host time
- **USB3 Vision** -- optional `u3v` feature for USB3 Vision cameras

## Usage

```bash
cargo add viva-genicam
```

```rust
use viva_genicam::{gige, Camera};
use std::time::Duration;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let devices = gige::discover(Duration::from_secs(1)).await?;
    let (mut camera, _xml) = viva_genicam::connect_gige(&devices[0]).await?;
    camera.set("ExposureTime", "5000")?;
    let val = camera.get("ExposureTime")?;
    println!("ExposureTime = {val}");
    Ok(())
}
```

## Feature flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `u3v` | Enable USB3 Vision transport |
| `u3v-usb` | Enable USB3 Vision with real USB hardware access (includes `u3v`) |
