//! `viva-camctl` — the GenICam diagnostic CLI, as a library.
//!
//! The command-line surface lives in [`cli`] and is driven by [`run`], so there
//! is exactly one implementation of it. The `viva-camctl` binary calls [`run`],
//! and so does the `viva-camctl` console script that `pip install viva-genicam`
//! installs — the Python users we most often ask for a `viva-camctl report` are
//! the ones least able to build it from source, and a second entry point would
//! be a second thing to keep in step.
