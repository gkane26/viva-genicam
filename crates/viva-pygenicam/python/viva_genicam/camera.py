        ``set(name, "1")`` does the same thing and always did, which is how
        this gap went unnoticed (issue #121) — but it reads like a write and
        the value it takes is discarded, so prefer ``execute``.

        Two distinct limitations, easily confused:

        * **A read after the command is stale, and waiting does not help.**
          ``<pInvalidator>`` is not parsed, so the cached nodemap never learns
          the command changed anything. The camera is updated; the stale value
          is ours. Reconnect to read the new settings back.
        * **``pIsDone`` polling is not implemented**, so this returns once the
          register write is acknowledged rather than once the camera has
          finished acting on it. A short sleep helps with this one.
